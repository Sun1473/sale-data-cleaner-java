# sale-data-cleaner-java
## 1. Project Title & Goal
This Java program cleans messy sales CSV data and converts it into a structured JSON report.

## 2. Setup Instructions
javac src/SalesDataCleaner.java  
java src.SalesDataCleaner

## 3. The Logic (How I thought)
I chose Java to demonstrate strong core programming skills without using external libraries.
The hardest part was handling duplicate records, which I solved using a HashSet to track unique product and price combinations.

## 4. Output Screenshots
(Embed screenshot of clean_sales.json opened in a text editor)

## 5. Future Improvements
I would add support for large files, better CSV parsing, and JSON libraries like Jackson for scalability.
